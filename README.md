# IBID-CCT
This is the repository for the IPM 2025 paper "IBID-CCT: A Novel Model for Interdisciplinary Breakthrough Innovation Detection based on Cusp Catastrophe Theory"
## Overview
IBID-CCT: A Novel Model for Interdisciplinary Breakthrough Innovation Detection based on Cusp Catastrophe Theory. The main contributions of this paper are reflected in the following five aspects.

- A comprehensive investigation and analysis of the mechanism and typical characteristics of interdisciplinary break-
through innovation.
- A novel model, IBID-CCT, for interdisciplinary breakthrough innovation detection based on various indicators and the
cusp catastrophe theory using eight machine learning and three deep learning models.
- Evaluate IBID-CCT and compare the performance with three baselines on a dataset with 3,075 papers, 1,340,482
citations, and 44,915 references.
- IBID-CCT models built on LGBM and BERT achieve the best performance and they outperform all the baselines.
- Analyze the impact of different indicators quantitively.
